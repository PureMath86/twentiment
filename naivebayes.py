"""
A classifier based on the Naive Bayes algorithm.  In order to find the
probability for a label, this algorithm first uses the Bayes rule to
express P(label|features) in terms of P(label) and P(features|label):

|                       P(label) * P(features|label)
|  P(label|features) = ------------------------------
|                              P(features)

The algorithm then makes the 'naive' assumption that all features are
independent, given the label:

|                       P(label) * P(f1|label) * ... * P(fn|label)
|  P(label|features) = --------------------------------------------
|                                         P(features)

Rather than computing P(featues) explicitly, the algorithm just
calculates the denominator for each label, and normalizes them so they
sum to one:

|                       P(label) * P(f1|label) * ... * P(fn|label)
|  P(label|features) = --------------------------------------------
|                        SUM[l]( P(l) * P(f1|l) * ... * P(fn|l) )

    A Naive Bayes classifier.  Naive Bayes classifiers are
    paramaterized by two probability distributions:

      - P(label) gives the probability that an input will receive each
        label, given no information about the input's features.

      - P(fname=fval|label) gives the probability that a given feature
        (fname) will receive a given value (fval), given that the
        label (label).

    If the classifier encounters an input with a feature that has
    never been seen with any label, then rather than assigning a
    probability of 0 to all labels, it will ignore that feature.

    The feature value 'None' is reserved for unseen feature values;
    you generally should not use 'None' as a feature value for one of
    your own features.
